/*
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
*/

let chessboard = '';
let size = 8;
for(r=1; r<=size; r++){
  for(c=1; c<=size; c++){
    if(r%2 != 0 && c%2 == 0 || r%2 == 0 && c%2 != 0)
      chessboard += '#';
    else
      chessboard += ' ';
  }
  chessboard += '\n';
}
console.log(chessboard);
